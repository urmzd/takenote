# Confreence

A secure, fast and extensible journal developed in Rust.

## Impetus
Sometimes I don't want to break away from my terminal to create quick documentation 
or a make a reminder of what I need to do next. Confreence is meant to serve a similar 
purpose to Atlassian's [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) but
with the all the benefits of a terminal-first, self-hosted and free (hence the name) solution.
