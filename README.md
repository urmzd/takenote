# Confreence

A secure, fast and extensible journal developed in Rust.

## Impetus

Sometimes I don't want to break away from my terminal to create quick notes, yes.., I'm lazy.
Confreence is meant to serve a similar purpose to Atlassian's [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) but
with the all the benefits of a terminal-first, self-hosted and free (hence the name) solution.

Confreence is meant to serve as a middle man for writing enthusiasts. Enabing high-speed content creation
in a matter of a few clicks.
